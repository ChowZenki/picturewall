KNOWN ISSUES/BUGS:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  - When search query is submitted on google server, and search option is changed to local image browse,still search queries are popupated inside view. 
	This is because when result are fetched from the google server are still downloading and once the download of those thumbnail view images are done, those images are populated inside view regardless wheather view is changed to other view or other search query.

  - Google search images might get duplicate images, i.e. Imagse populated inside view might be duplicated 
	This is cause of the query sent over google server returns searched result which has duplicate image URL
